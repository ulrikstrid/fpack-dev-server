# fastpack devserver

This is a hack to get a super basic dev server going for fastpack. I might itterate here and then propose a PR to fastpack.

## Start hacking

1.  clone this repo
1.  npm install
1.  node index.js

## TODO:

- [ ] Don't assume global fpack
- [ ] Take and pass params
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Get this in to fastpack propper
